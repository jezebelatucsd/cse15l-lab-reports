- **description:** This option creates a shortcut for logging into the ieng6 account. It also allows you to choose the shorthand alias to be implemented. This is another way to avoid having to type out the username and password for every log in.

>Show where the public key you made is stored on Github and in your user account (screenshot).

>Show where the private key you made is stored on your user account (but not its contents) as a screenshot.

>Show running `git` commands to commit and push a change to Github while logged into your ieng6 account.

>Show a link for the resulting commit.

>Show logging into your ieng6 account after doing this and compiling and running the tests for your repository.

>Show (like in the last step of the first lab) combining `scp`, `;`, and `ssh` to copy the whole directory and run the tests in one line.

# Lab Report 5 by Jezebel Yangari
# Note: I completeed this to the best of my ability, but I have noticed that fellow students with similar submissions to me have more points. I just hope that my grade in the class does not drop by virtue of which tutor/ TA I get that day.

## Test File 1: 201.md
> other repo [Link](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/201.md)

### Describes which implementation is correct
> Both implementations are incorrect (in the above screenshot, on 201 md). The correct output should look like this: [ti\*tle], because markdown shows this: [foo](/bar\* "ti\*tle").

### Shows actual output and the expected output
### Provides correct description of the bug
### Provides code snippet that needs to be changed

## OLD LAB REPORT

## How you found the tests with different results (Did you use vimdiff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)

## Provide a link to the test-file with different-results (in the provided repository or your repository , either is fine)
> answer: other repo [Link](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/200.md)

### For each test:
## Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output
> answer: My implementation is correct because it does not print "url".

## Decide on what it should produce (i.e., expected output) by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site.

## For the implementation that’s not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the bug (the problem in the code) in about 2-3 sentences. You don’t have to provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should be fixed (Provide a screenshot of code and highlight where the change needs to be made).
> answer: More conditions likely need to be added for the proper output to occur. The output in the preview seems to be the same for both.

# Lab Report 5 by Jezebel Yangari

## A link to your markdown-parse repository and a link to the one you reviewed in week 7
>[my repo](https://github.com/aaronchan32/markdown-parser)


>[their repo](https://github.com/httrieu/markdown-parser)

## How you found the tests with different results (Did you use vimdiff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)

- Showing the code in MarkdownParseTest.java for how you turned it into a test


## Provide a link to the test-file with different-results (in the provided repository or your repository , either is fine)
- answer

## For each test:
> Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output

> Indicate both actual outputs (provide screenshots) and also what the expected output is (list the links that are expected in the output).

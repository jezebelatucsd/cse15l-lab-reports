# Lab Report 4 by Jezebel Yangari

## A link to your markdown-parse repository and a link to the one you reviewed in week 7
>[my repo](https://github.com/aaronchan32/markdown-parser)


>[their repo](https://github.com/httrieu/markdown-parser)

## For each test above:
- Showing the code in MarkdownParseTest.java for how you turned it into a test

- For your implementation, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.

## Answer the following questions with 2-3 sentences each:
1) Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
> The issue with snippet 1 may lie in the back ticks that are scattere throughout. There might also have be if statements added to account for back ticks.


2) Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
> The issue with snippet 2 may lie in the extra paretheses and bracks that are scattered throughout. There might also have be if statements added to account for these issues.


3) Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
> The issue with snippet 3 may lie in the incomplete link implementation throught and the new lines added that are scattered throughout. There might have to be if statements added to account for these issues like new lines and all there might have to be chnages to the md file it self.

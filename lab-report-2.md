# Lab Report 2 by Jezebel Yangari

## Symptom Brought by All Chnages/Inputs, Infinite Loop

## Change 1/2:

## Chnage 3:
> Adding a for Loop to break when open parentheses and close paratheses are hit.
> The reasoning was the same for the previous chnages that were made.
> > We concluded that the reason there was an infinite loop was because the condition of the link ending was never met with repeated brackets and parentheses.

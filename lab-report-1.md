* Remotely Connecting

* Trying Some Commands
> I ran the commands ls -a and ls. The **ls -a** command opening the list of the current directory and hidden files. The **ls** command shows files and sub directories in the directory I was currently in.

* Moving Files with scp
> Here is used the **scp** command to move files in my computer to a remote one. This step was done after using the **exit** command to log out of my ieng6.

* Setting an SSH Key
> In this step I set the **SSH Key** to prevent from having to always type my password. I replaced my password with a pair of public and private key files. The **ssh** command then uses those as my password.

* Optimizing Remote Running
> Used key strokes as possible to run the program as few. One line consisted of running and compiling the WhereAmI.java file.

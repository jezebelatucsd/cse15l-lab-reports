* Trying Some Commands
> I ran the commands ls -a and ls. The **ls -a** command opening the list of the current directory and hidden files. The **ls** command shows files and sub directories in the directory I was currently in.

* Setting an SSH Key
> In this step I set the **SSH Key** to prevent from having to always type my password. I replaced my password with a pair of public and private key files. The **ssh** command then uses those as my password.

* Optimizing Remote Running
> At end of an **ssh** command, write a command in quotation marks to directly run it on the remote server, then use exit command or Ctrl+D. One line consisted of running and compiling the WhereAmI.java file.
